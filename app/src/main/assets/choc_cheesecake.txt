2. Blitz or crush the Oreos into a fine crumb
3. Pour the melted butter over the Oreo crumbs and stir until they're well coated

For the filling:
5. Combine the dark chocolate and 1/4 cup of the cream, microwave in 20 second increments. Stir each time until the chocolate is melted and completely smooth.
6. Whip the remaining cream until it starts to thicken. Slowly add the icing sugar and beat on high speed until stiff peaks form. Set it aside.
7. Beat the softened cream cheese until it's completely smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Next add the sugar and vanilla, then continue beating until smooth.
8. Add the melted chocolate, beating until it's completely mixed into the cream cheese.
9. Slowly fold in the whipped cream, half at a time until the mixture is completely smooth. Pour the filling into the prepared crust, spreading evenly. Refrigerate for 3-4 hours minimum.

10. Chop the chocolate into fine pieces, pour into a heat-proof bowl and set aside
11. Heat the cream either in a small saucepan or the microwave and remove before it boils
